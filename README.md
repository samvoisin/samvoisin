### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github profile! My name is Sam Voisin. I am a data science, machine learning and software design professional. I have extensive experience in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), time series analysis and Bayesian model techniques.

🦾 I am passionate about intuitive, gesture-based control systems. I am currently developing [GestuReMote](https://github.com/samvoisin/gesture-control), a python library which provides an interface for controlling your desktop/laptop with physical gestures.

🧙‍♂️ Another project I am working on is [AIDM](https://github.com/samvoisin/ai-dungeon-master), an LLM-powered chatbot that can act as a virtual "Game Master" for tabletop role-playing games. AIDM utilizes a combination of prompt engineering and software engineering features to ensure LLM produces appropriate text.

⛵️ I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at Tradewind Data Science where I build value for clients by developing inferrential and predictive models to guide strategy and policy decisions.
